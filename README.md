  <p>
    O angels and stars divine,<br>
    May recitals prompt a sign--<br>
    Distillation to align.<br>

  <p>
    The grass grows so slowly,<br>
    Blows so lightly,<br>
    Flows so freely,<br>
    And it calls itself home.<br>

  <hr width="50%">
  <p>
	  The reflection in the sea<br>
		Of the sun staring at me<br>
		Shimmers as mercilessly<br>
		As your clear divinity.<br>
		02|26|19
	</p>
	<hr width="50%">
	<p>
		Sunlight gently touches my fingertips,<br>
		But I burn from the inside out.<br>
		The stars feel bright. You are so<br>
		Ethereal and divine, I may burst.<br>
		01|12|19
	</p>
	<hr width="50%">
	<p>
		Poppies graze your hair and throat.<br>
		In veins crimson crystals float.<br>
		Air thickens; a storm blossoms.<br>
		Thunder strikes microcosms.<br>
		Angelic ichor lays bare<br>
		Beneath your dazzle and snare.<br>

	<hr width="50%">
	<p>
		I'll drag you back from whence you came,<br>
		'Cause an angel you were born!<br>
		A ghost you might remain forever,<br>
		But paradise won't scorn.<br>
		11|01|18... to Tessa
	</p>
	<hr width="50%">
	<p>
		About you stars whisper in broad daylight;<br>
		They know how heavy hearts can grow at night.<br>
		Birds remember when you left the seaside.<br>
		The shells you forgot fear your darkest tide.<br>
		11|01|18
	</p>
	<hr width="50%">
	<p>
		See its whispers and hear its gaze;<br>
		The swelling tide of eyes feel you.<br>
		Crystal cameras watch intently;<br>
		Passing angels stare so gently.<br>
		No pleas are needed in this haze;<br>
		The swelling tide of eyes make do.<br>
		10|18|18

  <p>
    Farewell, with love.
